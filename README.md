# Phase 4 Project, Creating a music playlist App

For my project of phase 4, I decided to create a site where several different users can create playlists of music using youtube urls.


## Setup

in order to get the program to run, please download all parts and run, in 2 seperate terminals, the commands   ***rails s***  and   ***npm start --prefix client***.   This will allow you to see the site at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).  Enjoy!


## Introduction

The site consists of a home landing page, where one is asked to either login  or create an account.  Once this is done you ae given the option to look at your list of playlists, and if you do not have one, or want a new one, you can add it.  Each playlist can store songs for you, and can be renamed if need be.
